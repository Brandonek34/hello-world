# hello-world
My first repository!
I am excited to be here! I am a 28 year old English major who realized post-graduation that I love technology and coding!
I have a Siberian husky named Rey. She is very naughty and cute.
My favorite things to do are write beautiful code and do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
